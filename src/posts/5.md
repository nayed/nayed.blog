I've been job hunting in 2015, 2018 and 2019 and it feels like it is 
getting harder everytime.

For the past couple of week I've been interviewing in some companies 
and I'm in uter shock by the questions I've been asked. What's going on?
I'm sorry am I interviewing for a web-tech startup or for engineering the 
next flight for Mars?

#### The All Mighty White Board
This. Right here. I have no idea why it is a thing. 
Sure I can use a white board for prototyping thoughts or sketchs. 
But there is no way that asking a candidate to code an entire program on 
a white board is a good indication to how well they will be on

I realize that this post may shut some opportunities at some companies but 
honestly? I don't want to work with people that believe that what makes 
a good programmer is how much algorithms they memorized by heart instead of 
their actual skills on the job.
