Alright. I think this is the 4th time in 6 years that I'm starting a 
new blog. But this time, this is it. This time I'll be serious about blogging.
I took 3 days to learn [Gatsby](https://gatsbyjs.org) and code this blog.
I bought this kickass nayed.blog domain name. I already have several posts 
idea for this blog. Yep, everything is set for me to finally blog. For real.  
Welcome to my blog. My name is Nayed SaÃ¯d Ali and I'll be talking about tech 
stuff and other non-tech stuff.

But what I like to start as a first post is my story. Here it is.

I was born the 6th of February, 1992, in a little archipelago between Africa 
and Madagascar called [Comoros](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comoros).
Born in [Moroni](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moroni,_Comoros) the capital 
city of Comoros. But actually I did not lived there, you see Comoros are 
made of 4 islands and I lived the first 8 years of my life on the island of 
[Mayotte](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mayotte).

I lived a quiet and peaceful life there, without knowing the cold, the 
pollution or other #FirstWorldProblem /s.  
I had a fantastic childhood there. I remember playing hours and hours of 
Tomb Raider, Crash Bandicoot, Tekken and other 90s games on the PlayStation. 
Yep, good 'ol 90s childhood. When I was playing, I remember asking my parents 
and other relatives HOW video games are made. It was so fascinating it seemed 
almost magical. And I think it's at that time that I begun my interest in 
computers. There was an Internet cafÃ© that openned across the street and I was 
fascinated by those little interactive tv-box-thing...

Then in late 2000 we moved to France (not my first time there, we travelled quite 
a lot in my childhood) in [Marseille](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marseille). 
We did not stay there very long, less than a year.

And then we moved to the city I consider it to be my hometown, my spot, my hills, 
my heaven, my hood: [Lyon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lyon). (Yes I'm a very 
proud *lyonnais*).  
I stayed there from 9 to 26 years-old. Those 17 years were incredible. It's the 
end of my childhood, all of my teenagehood and the beginning of my adulthood.

And this is were my other big passion has its roots. From elementary school to 
high school I saw the football team of my city, 
l'[Olympique Lyonnais](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Olympique_Lyonnais) win 
7 successive domestic titles (a record in France.. and maybe in Europe?). 
I remember every big wins and defeats. I saw them beating Real Madrid for years 
and years (3-0, 2-0, 1-0, and in round of 16). I was sad when they lost the 
most important games in the Champions League. Well you probably get the idea. 
This is my favorite football team.

In the meantime, I had my first computer in 2003 at 11. An awesome Packard Bell 
that lasts 8 years, which for today electronic devices may seems like 
an eternity. With it, oh boy, I have so many hours of play-time. I don't 
play a lot of different games, but when I choose a game it's for 1000's hours. 
Mostly on this bad boy, I played a korean MMORPG called Rappelz, Trackmania, 
Civilization, GTA San Andreas and you can already guess my favorite game: FIFA.

Like every teens of my generation, the internet was my playground. We stayed 
hours chatting on MSN, laughing at memes and watching videos on Dailymotion and 
later Youtube. Everyone of us had a Skyblog (a kind of french tumblr at that 
time) or a MySpace (I did not have, and never 'get it'). And all of a sudden, 
Facebook was THE thing to have (funny how none of my friends are using it now..)

Alright let's go back a little bit. We are somewhere between 2005 and 2006. 
Maybe sooner, maybe later I don't recall. I found a website that has changed 
my life and it is one of the main reason why I wanted to be a web developer.

You know how people says that Apple revolutionized the smartphone industry right? 
So who revolutionized the web industry? Remember how websites looked like in 
2000-2010? Basically, it was kind of like looking at.. documents? And you were 
just scrolling in the page til the end unless there were some link and you 
clicked on it and it opened another document to scroll etc. So how did we go 
from that era to interactive website, live-streaming content and 360Â° videos?

For me, there is this website that blew my mind and I will not be surprised 
if it was the same for the web industry. This website is.. Google Earth.

Remember, I mean remember! Almost all of the websites looked like documents 
with some colors, pictures and links. And then there was Google Earth. 
This shit was LIT ðŸ”¥ðŸ”¥ðŸ”¥ (and still is). You could see the Earth, turn around, 
zoom to some random area in the world and just, playing around. It was as 
interactive as.. as a video game in a web browser! This was my second HOW did 
they make it. That's it. This. Right there. I wanna make some awesome cool 
stuff on the web when I'll be an adult. This was my calling to become a web 
developer. I'm sure of it.

And here I am, after 4 years of programming education and several internships, 
I moved to Paris, to be closer to companies that has an impact on the internet 
and to fulfill my dream.

So welcome to my blog. My name is Nayed SaÃ¯d Ali and I'll be talking about tech 
stuff and other non-tech stuff.

*Plus ultra*
